Recursive Factorial Calculation 

Recursion is a technique to divide and conquer: solve a problem by solving its subproblems.
In coding, recursion involves a method calling itself repeatedly until a base case is encountered.  Then it repeatedly returns.

Whenever a method is called, all of the info (state) of the caller is saved in the runtime call stack. Same thing happens during recursion.  Each recursive call results in a fresh version of the method with its own variables called a stack frame.
